Season Trends: Monitor season-specific trends to adapt marketing strategies or highlight narratives.

#### 6. Training and Decision Making
Coaching Strategies: Assist coaches and analysts in preparing strategies by studying opponent strengths and weaknesses.
Data-Driven Decisions: Enable franchises to use data insights for real-time decision-making during matches.

#### 7. Visualization of Key Metrics
Create dashboards and visualizations that simplify complex data, making it easy for stakeholders to interpret trends, compare metrics, and make informed decisions.
